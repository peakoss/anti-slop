I tried deploying it multiple times and this behavior is consistent all the time.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1267\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfaf53de-3eed-4368-9670-b3abdcfe728f\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor Agreement\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n > - [x] I have read and understood the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/v4.x/CONTRIBUTING.md).
